Except... 
What is it, Cody? 
Well... they can see us too. 
Oh. Do you think a cat is delicious to a triceratops? 
Oh no! They eat plants! 
What's the problem, then? 
Have you noticed the size of their feet? 
Are you worried their feet will be smelly? 
No! I'm worried they're going to tread on us! 
So what are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
I'm going to code, of course! 
How are you going to do it?
