The legend said that if any man should marry the giant Ysbaddaden's daughter, the giant himself would die. 
Ysbaddaden an old tree --enormous, hairy, and muscled like did not want to die. 
He made himself fearsome. He refused to bathe, so that his stench would strike down everything for miles and miles around. 
Alone with his daughter in his fortified castle, he struck down instantly any man who presented himself to his gates.
