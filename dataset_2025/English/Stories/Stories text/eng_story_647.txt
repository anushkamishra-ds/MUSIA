Anyway, let's go and check out the triceratops, I really want to see them... 
Uh... Cody Cat? 
What? 
Have you noticed something? 
What? 
Well, that lake for example. It's frozen solid. 
Oh, yes... it is. 
And it's snowing! 
Argh! The Cretaceous is supposed to be tropical! 
What do you think has happened, Cody Cat? 
Err... I might just have triggered an Ice Age... 
So what are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
Well, I guess I'm going to code! 
How are you going to do it?
