At the mention of the giant's daughter, Culhwch coloured. His cheeks went the tone of musk, as he felt a love for this unknown maiden infuse every part of him. It ran headlong through the veins of his body, and tingled out to the very surface of his skin. 
His father, seeing him turn pink, asked, "Why are you that shade? Are you sick?" 
Still blushing, Culhwch said, "My stepmother said I would marry none but the daughter of the giant Ysbaddaden." 
"And do you want to?" 
"Yes!" he said vehemently. 
It was not experience which spoke, but something instead like destiny. It made him more certain of his love for her than he had ever been of any of the real things in his life. 
The King knew how he felt, for he had once loved his mother the same.
