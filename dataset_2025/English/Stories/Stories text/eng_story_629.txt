The next morning, the couple showed Culhwch and Arthur's knights to the gate, and let them in. They found the giant Ysbaddaden, who was so surprised that he did not kill them at first sight, but rather believed himself to be dreaming. 
As he was eating at his breakfast table, he reached for his cutlery and said to Culhwch, "Use these two forks and raise up my eyelids so that I may see that I am not mad. 
Culhwch wedged the forks beneath his fearsome brow, and nearly swooned at the stench of him; at the years and years of breakfasts which were embedded in his beard, and the worms in his ears. 
"I wish to marry your daughter," Culhwch said. 
"Come tomorrow and I will give you my answer," said the giant. 
But as the knights turned to leave, he took one of three poisoned spears and hurled them at the party. Bedwyr, who was the fastest in the land, caught it and threw it back. It speared right through the ball of the giant's knee. His roars of pain rang in their ears as they retreated.
