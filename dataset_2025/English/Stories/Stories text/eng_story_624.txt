Culhwch entered the great stone hallway, marched through the merrymaking, and soon stood before the King, shining from head to toe as though dipped in gold. 
King Arthur saw something proud in his bearing; he rose from his chair and took him to a private room. 
"What do you want from me, golden stranger?" asked King Arthur. 
"I would like you to cut my hair," said Culhwch. 
Flattered, the King took out his instruments. For in his kingdom, when men cut hair together, they were binded for life. 
Sure enough, as he took Culhwch's fair curls between his fingers, he said, "I feel as though I know you; as though you must be my kinsman. Is it true?" 
"It is true," said Culhwch. 
"Then what do you seek?" 
"I seek the daughter of the giant Ysbaddaden." 
"Ah, that is a difficult path," murmured Arthur. "But I have more than two hundred men in my knighthood. I will find you six companions who will help you in your quest."
