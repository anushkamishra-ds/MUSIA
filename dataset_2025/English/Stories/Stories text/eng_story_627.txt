The shepherd was surprised to see them, but invited them home with his wife. They offered the knights a meal, which after days of wandering aimlessly across a barren land they were very happy to share. 
When the dinner was eaten and the cheese was laid out, the wife stood and opened a box beside the fireplace. Out of it stepped a young boy with brown, curly hair. 
"The giant Ysbaddaden has killed twenty three of my sons, she said. "And I do not hold hopes for this one either. 
Cei said "Let him join our knights, then, We will be killed together, or not at all." 
Pleased, the wife nodded. "But why have you come to this dreadful place?" she asked. 
"To seek the giant's daughter," Culhwch said eagerly. Just the thought of her had caused the blood to run to his face and to his limbs: he was dizzy with love. 
"Olwen!" said the woman. "That is dangerous!" 
Olwen! It was a beautiful name. Culhwch felt that he would swoon, 
"Can we see her?" he humbly asked. 
"Only if you promise not to do her harm," said the woman. They pledged it.
