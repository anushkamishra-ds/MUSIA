The giant's daughter Olwen was sent for and she came. 
She stepped through the doorway wearing a robe of silk the colour of a candle, eddying and flickering as the most lively of flames. Around her neck was a noble torque of rose gold, and her hair was studded with precious stones: rubies, garnets and sapphires. As though aflame with all this colour, her beauty was flushed: her cheeks a delicate pink against the exquisite pale of her face. 
Culhwch was sure that whoever beheld her would love her. And as he peered from the door behind her, he saw that white flowers sprang from wherever her strong feet had fallen. 
"Ah, maiden," said Culhwch, falling to his knees. "It is you I have always loved. Please come with me of your own accord, and I will make you as happy as you were born to be." 
Olwen looked at Culhwch and in that moment loved him too. Was it destiny? Or simply his earnest gaze, his open heart, and the determination that he had shown to have her? 
But "Alas, I cannot," she said regretfully. "My father will die the moment that I am wed; it is prophesied. All I can counsel is that you go and ask him for my hand, and do whatever he asks of you. Whatever he demands of you, promise to get it, and we will soon belong to each other."
