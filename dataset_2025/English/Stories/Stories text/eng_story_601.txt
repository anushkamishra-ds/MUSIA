So when Little Pink Caterpillar slipped out of an egg, the other caterpillars were very surprised. 
The butterflies flapped their wings. "There's no such thing as a pink caterpillar!" 
The worm shook his head, or it might have been his tail. "I've never seen such a thing! Caterpillars are never, ever pink..." 
"However did that happen?" The white fluttery moths flapped their wings. 
Ladybird laughed. "Pink caterpillars? Whatever next!"
