Right! Now we're back on the ground. 
Now what was it that you wanted to do? 
Literally all I want to see is a triceratops.... I think I can hear a herd. 
Oh good! I want to see a triceratops too! 
Just around this tree, and... Argh! 
What's up, Cody Cat? 
Well they're just there. But I can't see them! 
Why can't you see them? 
This big, thick, heavy mist has just swooped in! I can hear them, but I can't see a thing! 
Maybe the tornado brought it in... 
Maybe... 
So what are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
So I'm going to code, of course! 
How are you going to do it?
