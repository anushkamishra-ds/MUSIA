Daisy had a big basket, and one by one she dropped the berries in. Helen watched. It looked easy enough, so she gave it a go. 
Pop! it went. Then pop! again. 
Daisy said, "Maybe try being softer," so Helen did, and pop! the berry went. 
Fifty berries later, Helen was done. She hadn't managed to get a single berry in the basket, but had a face full of berry juice.
