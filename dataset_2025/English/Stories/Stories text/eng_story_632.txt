"I am not finished!" declared the giant. "Next, do you see that field over there? It looks empty, but it is filled with white and black flax that has not yet sprouted. You must find the white flax seeds, and replant them in this field, so that my daughter will have pure white flax for her veil." 
"That will be easy for me to do, though you do not think it is easy," said Culhwch. 
"And then!" said the giant. "You must find honey nine times sweeter than usual, without drone or queen, to make bragget for the feast. You must locate the cup of Llwyr, as no vessel is stronger to hold strong drink. It must be served in the horn of Gwlgawd Gododdin. And you must borrow the hamper of Gwyddneu Longshank, which overflows with enough meat to feed the world. None of these people will give up their treasures willingly, but willingly they must be given, in order for us to have food and drink for the feast." 
"That will be easy for me to do, though you do not think it is easy," said Culhwch.
