Suddenly a voice from above her said, "Hey, Mrs Hen!" 
Then when she stopped to look around, she heard that same voice say, "Pst! Up here!" 
Helen looked up, and I'm going to be honest, I really thought lona the cat was going to eat her, but this is what happened instead. 
lona explained that she had found some eggs in a tree that the forest rangers had planted, and had been looking after them ever since.
