On the last day, they entered the room cautiously, saying, "Don't throw any more spears at us." The giant Ysbaddaden agreed, and asked once more that Culhwch put forks on his eyelids to hold them up. And this time, before he could even draw near, the giant hurled the last of his poisoned spears at Culhwch, who caught it and launched it back, where it penetrated the giant's great rheumy eye. 
With his hand clapped on his blinded eye, the giant finally agreed to talk to Culhwch. 
"You may marry my daughter," he said. "But you must do it the proper way. 
"I will," said Culhwch. 
"Firstly, then," said the giant. "Do you see that wild thicket that extends for one thousand miles behind the castle? You must uproot each weed, and burn the whole of it to the ground, so that the cinders and ashes fertilise it. Then you must plough it. It can only be cleared and ploughed by a strong man called Amaethon. He must come of his free will: you cannot compel him. He must furthermore use two oxen of Gwlwlydd, yoked together, also given freely. As you know, these oxen are so strong and so rare that they will be impossible to borrow. Then you must seed it with fine plants and flowers. This must all be done in one day. Only then will we have sufficient space for the wedding. 
"That will be easy for me to do, though you do not think it is easy," said Culhwch.
