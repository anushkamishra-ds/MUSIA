"Now for the entertainment!" exclaimed the giant. 
"The harp of Teirtu is the only thing which may entertain the guests at a wedding fit for my daughter. This instrument is magical, for when a man pleases, it plays by itself. And when one wants silence, it stops. And likewise, the only possible worthy accompaniment is the music of the swallows of Rhiannon, which wake the dead and lull the living to sleep. All of these things are exceedingly difficult to find, and yet find them you must." 
"That will be easy for me to do, though you do not think it is easy," said Culhwch. 
"And lastly, I may not attend my daughter's wedding in such a state. Only the tusk of Ysgithyrwyn, Chief Boar, is fine enough to shave my forest of beard, but it will only work if it is plucked from the great swine's head while he is still alive. Then, the tusk must be kept by Cadw of Prydein, but I fear at the sight of the tusk he will become passionate about its ownership, and will not release it of his own free will. And lastly, even after combing my hair, I will only be able to tame it with the blood of the Black Witch, who lives in the Valley of Grief in the uplands of Hell. 
Culhwch nodded to all of these impossible demands. 
"I have horses, and King Arthur is my kinsman. I will win your daughter, and you will lose your life."
