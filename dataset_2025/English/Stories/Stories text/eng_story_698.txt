Rosemary the robin landed on the branches next to Helen and said in her sweet little voice, "Do you need anything, sweetie? I haven't seen you move from these eggs..." 
Helen said, "No thank you; I'm used to sitting still for a long time." 
Rosemary said, "I hope there's something nice in those eggs!" 
Helen said, "We will see soon enough. I can feel them giggling."
