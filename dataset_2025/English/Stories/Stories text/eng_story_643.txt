Yeah? 
Have you noticed something...? 
What?

Well, maybe a little... 
You have fur. You must feel it more than me! 
Maybe you're right. 
What do you think is happening? It feels like the temperature is rising! We don't want to cause a dangerous heatwave! 
Oh no... 
What are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
I'm going to code! 
How are you going to do it?
