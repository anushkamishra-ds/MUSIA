He gave him Cei, who could hold his breath under water for nine days and nine nights. Cei could strike a man and make a wound that would never heal. He could become as tall as the tallest tree in the forest whenever he pleased. And when it rained, he remained dry, for the fire in his blood ran hot and would evaporate the water before it hit him. Indeed, in the depths of winter, his brothers would nestle into him to stay warm and alive. 
Arthur also gave him Bedwyr, who was the fastest knight in the kingdom to wield a sword, despite having only one hand. 
He gave him Cynddylig the Guide, who knew every place as though he had been there before. 
He gave him Gwyhyr, Interpreter of Tongues, who could speak in any language, including the languages of trees, beasts, the sea, the moon and stars, the wind, fire, earth, and many more besides. 
He gave him Gwalchmei, who was the best rider in his kingdom, as well as the best walker. Gwalchmei also had the talent of never having lost a quest that he had sought, and so was a kind of lucky charm. 
And finally, Arthur gave him Menw, who could cast a spell so that they were invisible to everyone but themselves.
