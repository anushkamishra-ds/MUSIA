Well, rainbows come when there's rain. But there's not even any rain right now. 
I'm going to say IF rainbows appear with no rain, THEN remove the rainbow. 
if (rainbow appears without rain) { remove rainbow 
} 
You did it, Cody Cat. I guess that's better for the environment. 
Though they were REALLY PRETTY...
