Culhwch staged himself in a manner befitting a kinsman of King Arthur. He set off for his cousin's kingdom on a young, sleek horse, which playfully reared as he rode. It was magnificent, with decorated hoofs, a golden bridle and saddle, and hair brushed until it was glossy as water.  Culhwch himself was also adorned in finery: he rode like a child of the sun. He carried two spears of shining silver, a honed golden battle-axe with a diamond handpiece, and a gold-bladed sword which nestled into his thigh within a golden hilt. His feet were locked into golden stirrups. Draped around him was a fine woollen mantle of purple, with four golden-red apples embroidered onto it, one in each corner. And riding before him were two pale greyhounds, collared in rose gold.  At the gate to Arthur's castle, the guards would not let him in.  "If you do not let me in," said Culhwch, raising himself up in his saddle, "I will shout three times so loudly that it will be heard across the breadth of your lands. All the women in earshot will become barren."  Surprised, the guards let him through.
