So, are you happy? 
Oh yes, look at all those beautiful triceratops! They're magnificent! 
They really are, Cody Cat. 
I love the way they're sparkling in the sunshine, beneath all the rainbows... 
Rainbows? 
Yes! Look at all the rainbows in the sky! 
There must be a hundred of them! Don't you think that's a bit too many... scientifically? 
Is it? 
I've never seen more than two or three at once. 
Argh catnip! It must be a glitch. A rainbow glitch. 
So what are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
I'm going to code! 
How are you going to do it?
