So formed, this little army of knights set off for the giant's castle in the desolate mountain valley, where Ysbaddaden's stench had killed every tree and bush, and nothing but stiff grass remained. 
Soon they saw the valley stretched out before them: it was green-grey and formless as a dream. A flock of sheep grazed on the stones, and there was no beginning or end to them. 
The knights walked for four days before they realised that they never got any closer to the fortified castle. Every day they set out was the same as the day before. 
On the fourth day, though, they saw an old shepherd with a bristled mastiff roaming through the furze and prickles. This dog, they saw, was something like a demon, for he had fiery breath which he habitually exhaled when he panted, singeing the stones and evaporating the stiff grass to ash. 
Cei told Gwyhyr to speak to the shepherd. "For you speak in all tongues," he said. "Find out why we cannot draw closer to the fortified castle." 
But Gwyhry refused. "I did not come here to go anywhere alone," he said. "We knights are better together." 
"Then I will cast a spell over the dog," said Menw, "So it will do harm to none."
