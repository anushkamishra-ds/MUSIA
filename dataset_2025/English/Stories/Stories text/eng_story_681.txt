As I was drinking my morning cup of tea, I saw a red hen. Her name was Helen. I had never before seen her waddle into the woods. She looked very tired - she must have come from far away. 
Suddenly a giant hoof stomped in front of her. It was followed by a deep voice that said, "Sorry down there, I didn't see you!" 
Helen just kept waddling on.
