Now I think we should start exploring... 
Uh... Cody Cat? 
What? 
Can you see lightning over there? 
Oh yes! Wow, there's a lot of it! 
It seems to be coming closer... 
Say that again? I can't hear you over the thunder! 
What's happening, Cody Cat? This seems like a glitch. I've never seen so many thunderstorms, ever! 
Hmm... yes. Yes, I think it's a thunderstorm glitch. 
Can you fix it? 
Of course I can fix it! 
And how are you going to do that, Cody Cat? 
I'm going to code! 
How are you going to do it?
