Shh! I've just seen a whole group of Spinosaurus tiptoe past! 
Wow, Cody. That's really cool! 
Yes! If we just follow them... 
Oh no, Cody! What just happened?! 
Help! I'm spinning in the air! 
Oh no! And look over towards the horizon. It's a whole group of tornados! What could possibly have caused that? 
I suppose it's never good to play too much with the weather... 
Watch out Cody Cat! You don't want it to whisk you away! 
I guess I'm just going to have to code! Fast! 
How are you going to do it?
