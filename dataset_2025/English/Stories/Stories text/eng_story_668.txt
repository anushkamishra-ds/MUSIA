A lovely maid named Mindy-May 
Was walking through the streets that day. 
Young Mindy-May had come to town 
To buy supplies to make a gown. 
A handsome lad whose name was Rance 
Had asked her to the local dance. 
And Mindy-May had told him, "Yes," 
Now all she needed was a dress. 
Her mum would make one, stitch-by-stitch 
(It didn't hurt that Rance was rich).
