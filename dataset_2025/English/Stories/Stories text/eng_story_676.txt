The maiden's name was Alice Brown. 
She carried milk throughout the town. 
And when she saw the Beggar-King 
She said, "Oh my! You poor, poor thing! 
You look as if you've had it rough. 
I'm sorry life can be so tough. 
But you have found a friend in me. 
Here. Take some milk. Go on. It's free!"
