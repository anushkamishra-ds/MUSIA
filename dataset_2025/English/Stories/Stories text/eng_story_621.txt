Far from Ysbaddaden, a king named Cilydd lost his wife. Driven mad by the sight of pigs, she gave him a son and then died. 
Eighteen winters later, the king found a new wife. She was eager to make a family of the son, and said he would make a good match for her daughter. 
But the son - whose name was Culhwch -protested that he was too young. And offended, the wife blue with fury cursed him. -
She said that in this case, he would marry none but the daughter of the fearsome giant Ysbaddaden. 
In saying so, what she meant to say, is that the probability being so unlikely, Culhwch would marry no one at all. 
But something rather different happened.
