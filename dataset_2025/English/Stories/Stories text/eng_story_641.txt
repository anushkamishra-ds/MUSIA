Cody Cat, what's the problem? 
Well, it just never stops raining in the Cretaceous period! 
Is that such a problem? 
Look how wet I am! You know cats hate water, right? 
Yes... 
And there's mud everywhere! It's going to take AGES to lick it off! 
So what are you going to do, Cody Cat? 
I'm going to code! 
How are you going to do it?
